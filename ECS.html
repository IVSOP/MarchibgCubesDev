<h1 id="storing-entities">Storing entities</h1>
<p>Very early on it became obvious I needed some way of storing
entities. It was also clear that I won’t use OOP (I hate it and it
wouldn’t work here anyway), and that different entities need to have
different attributes. An easy solution would be to make a struct with
all the different attributes an entity could have. This is bad because
it not only wastes space but also needs several extra checks to see what
attributes the entity actually has, slowing everything down. I needed a
quick way to traverse entities that had certain attributes, while doing
so efficiently. But how?</p>
<h1 id="entity-component-system">Entity Component System</h1>
<p>After some researching, I learned about ECS, and that it was very
common for games. The idea is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each entity has an ID</li>
<li>Each entity has one or more components</li>
<li>A system does logic over entities that have a certain combination of
components</li>
</ul>
<p>I was unsure if this is actually what I wanted at first. Usually the
solutions with a lot of flexibility and hierarchy come at the cost of
performance. I saw more videos about why it was bad than why it was
good, but I wanted to see it for myself.</p>
<h1 id="entt">EnTT</h1>
<p>I then came across <a href="https://github.com/skypjack/entt">EnTT</a>, and even saw that The
Cherno made a <a href="https://youtu.be/D4hz0wEB978">video</a> on it. I
was surprised at how simple it was. It actually felt like compile-time
magic. It also did EXACTLY what I needed, storing entities efficiently
in a way that allows for fast traversal of entities with a certain
combination of components. So, I decided to use it.</p>
<h1 id="the-segfaults">The segfaults</h1>
<p>At first everything was going great, entt was easy to use and worked
fine. Then, the segfaults attacked. Long story short, entt is actually
more nuanced than it seems at first, due to C++ things. Objects were
getting copied/moved/destroyed and constructed again where I didn’t want
this to happen, as 1) it’s slow and 2) most of my objects own some
internal pointers which are meant to be freed at the end of their life.
I also don’t want to define 20 different operators for my sexy and clean
structs so I had to dive into the docs to see what I could do.</p>
<h1 id="lazy-guide-to-entt">Lazy guide to EnTT</h1>
<h2 id="creating-a-registry-and-entities">Creating a registry and
entities</h2>
<p>The registry is what owns the entities and their data. You can create
it, along with an entity, by just doing</p>
<pre class="cpp"><code data-highlighted="yes" class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-keyword">include</span> <span class="hljs-string">&lt;entt.hpp&gt;</span></span>

entt::registry registry;
entt::entity entity = entt_registry.<span class="hljs-built_in">create</span>();</code></pre>
<h2 id="adding-components">Adding components</h2>
<p>Obviously you need to be able to add components to your entities. You
can do so like this:</p>
<pre class="cpp"><code data-highlighted="yes" class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">MyComponent</span> {
    ...
};

registry.<span class="hljs-built_in">emplace</span>&lt;MyComponent&gt;(entity, args...);</code></pre>
<h2 id="iterating-over-entities">Iterating over entities</h2>
<p>This is where it gets confusing. There is a lot more to entt than it
seems at first. The docs explain everything well, the problem is there
is a lot to explain, and without segfaulting everywhere you won’t know
what features you need.</p>
<p>You can use either views or groups to iterate over entities. Since I
read in the docs that groups are faster but with more limitations,
that’s what I’ll use. I will only optimize it once it becomes a
bottleneck, which is pretty far from happening yet.</p>
<p>Using a group to get the entities with <code>MyComponent</code>
component:</p>
<pre class="cpp"><code data-highlighted="yes" class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-keyword">auto</span> group = registry.<span class="hljs-built_in">group</span>&lt;MyComponent&gt;();
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">auto</span> entity : group) {
    MyComponent &amp;component = group.<span class="hljs-built_in">get</span>&lt;MyComponent&gt;(entity);

    ...
}</code></pre>
<p>I found out the hard way that this causes the MyComponent struct to
be copied/moved. You can fix that by making it not be owned by the
group, at a performance cost. Example with two components, neither being
owned by the group:</p>
<pre class="cpp"><code data-highlighted="yes" class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-keyword">auto</span> group = registry.group&lt;&gt;(entt::get&lt;MyComponent1, MyComponent2&gt;);
...</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Doing this does NOT work:</p>
<pre class="cpp"><code data-highlighted="yes" class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-keyword">auto</span> group1 = registry.<span class="hljs-built_in">group</span>&lt;A&gt;(entt::get&lt;B&gt;);
<span class="hljs-keyword">auto</span> group2 = registry.<span class="hljs-built_in">group</span>&lt;A&gt;(entt::get&lt;C&gt;);</code></pre>
<p>Since A is owned by two groups at once, things go bad and you get a
segfault.</p>
<p>In the future I plan on reusing created groups and making them
full-owning groups, so I will update this when needed.</p>
